Western Digital WD16 CPU Emulator

Based on the excellent work of Mike Noel http://www.kicksfortso.com/Am100/

Two versions of the 1600 were created using the same chips. The MCP1600 used the microms with microinstructions that created a 8-bit microprocessor and the MP1600 used microms that created a 16-bit microprocessor. The 1600 chip set was also referred to as the WD-16 or WD16.

The 1600 is most well known for its use in the implementation of the DEC LSI-11 microcomputers. It was used in the Alpha Micro Systems AM100, the Western Digital 9000 Pascal Microengine and in many automation and control systems.
